    st.header("Key Points:")
    st.markdown("- **Approaches:** Implemented both simple models and neural networks.")
    st.markdown("- **Dataset:** Utilized the Kaggle ECG Heartbeat Categorization Dataset.")
    st.markdown("- **Accuracy:** Achieved high accuracy scores with simple models in predicting overall heartbeat pattern shape and distinguishing between normal and abnormal patterns.")
    st.markdown("- **Neural Networks:** Marginally higher accuracy scores observed, with a tendency towards 'conservativeness' â€“ favoring false positives, which is desirable in medical applications.")
    st.markdown("- **Next Steps:** These initial findings pave the way for further exploration into neural networks' behavior in detecting ECG heartbeat patterns.")
