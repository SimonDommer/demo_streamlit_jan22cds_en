# Streamlit Demo

## Test: Can Simon edit something here and push it onto github without affecting the main branch?

## Why Streamlit:
The classic data science workflow is as follows:

![Workflow_data_scientist](/assets/streamlit_1.png "Pipeline MLOPS")

**Streamlit** is a python library (often referred to as a framework) that allows you to create beautiful graphical application interfaces in a very short time.

Streamlit acts **as a web interface** between the Python language and other libraries (e.g. HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc).

From the moment we want to create a graphical user interface, we can use Streamlit to visually communicate with the various stakeholders in the company.

## General information about Streamlit:

## Streamlit installation:

What you will need:
* Text editor
* Installation command below:

``` python
Pip install streamlit 
#(pipenv install streamlit dans une environnement virtuel)
```

## Methodology for developing an application:

A possible working methodology:

1. **Design of the application window**: 

The first step is the design of the application window (see below).

â†’ Be imaginative: Imagine the 'look' of your future app (colours, layouts, menus, content etc.)

2. **Designing the architecture**:

The second step **is not writing lines of code** but designing the architecture of the application.

Draw the relationships between a set of files (design of the code directory architecture).

*Ex:*

Once you have the window and the architecture in mind, it is easier to write the corresponding code.

## How to launch the demo:

1. **Go to the app directory:**

``` bash
# Change directory
cd app
```
2. **Run the `app.py` script:**

``` python
# Run streamlit app
streamlit run app.py
```
